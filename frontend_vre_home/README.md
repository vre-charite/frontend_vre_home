This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.


# coding standards

## Folder

```jsx
- components
	- Common // for shared component
	- About
		- AboutHeader
			- AboutHeader.tsx
			- AboutHeader.module.scss
		- AboutFooter
			- AboutFooter.tsx
			- AboutFooter.module.scss
- pages
	- index.tsx
	- about
		- index.tsx
		- index.module.scss
		- about-sub
			- index.tsx
			- index.module.scss
```

- for pages, all folder and `.tsx` files are `kebab-case`. For each route, defined a folder for that route, and create `index.tsx` for the page. directly use `about/about-sub.tsx` is not recommended, since we may introduce style file or test file for that `.tsx` in the  future.
- Components are grouped by page in the `compoents` folder. For example, `component/About` contains all the components for `about` page. All the folders in `component/About` are flatten. That means each component has its own folder, and each folder only contains one component without nested folders. All folder and `.tsx` file in `components` are `PascalCase` .

## React Component

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
// other imports

// require or decomposing object
const _ = require('lodash');
const { Content } = Layout;

// local constant
const MAX_ITEMS = 20;

function About(props) {
  // 1. decompose props
  const {name,path,description} = props;
  // 2. hook for states
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const {username} = useSelector(state=>state);
  const func = useMemo(()=>{},[]);

  //3. useEffect
  useEffect(()=>{
    func();
  },[]);

  // 4. helper functions
  const submitForm = (form)=>{
    // 
  }

  // 5. event methods
  const onFinish = ()=>{
    submitForm(form)
  }

  const onClick = ()=>{

  };

  // 6. data transformation for complicated data structure
  const birthplaces = users.map(user=>user.info?.birthplaces);

  // 7. if a component has too many props, extract them into a object and define it here
  const aboutSubProps = {
    name,
    path,
    loading,
    setLoading,
    //...
  };

  // 8. if the returned jsx is too long, extract some of them into constant here
  const LeftSideBar = (<div>{/* around 10-50 lines of code */}</div>);

  // 9. return 
  return <div>
    {LeftSideBar}
    <AboutSub {...aboutSubProps} />
  </div>
}
```

The react component can be written as above.

If the `.tsx` file is more than 250 lines, consider a refactoring.

## Scss file

defined class as `kebab-case`, like `about-header`. Then use the class in jsx like:

```jsx
import styles from './index.module.scss'

//...
<div className={styles["about-header"]} ></div>
```
